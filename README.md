# Estimating the effect of intervention through artificial intelligence and propensity score matching
 
<p> The files are structured as follows: </p>

<p> Jupyter notebooks -> lalonde.ipynb - Exploratory data analysis and ML for propensity score estimation (Logistic regression,classification tree,Random forest,extreme gradident boosted tree ,artificial neurual netowork) </p>

<p>The seperate artificial neural network notebooks implement ANN's using mainly pytorch, however there are issues with these models , the model used in our thesis is implemented with skorch (in the main lalonde notebook), this allows allows use sklearns grid search. </p>

<p> Jupyter notebooks -> syntheticstudies.ipynb - simulated experimental and nonexperiemntal datasets for testing models given ideal conditions (large sample sizes, balanced covariates </p> 
<p> R-script -> Matched samplea nlysis.R - Matching , stratification and average treatment effect estimates  </p>
