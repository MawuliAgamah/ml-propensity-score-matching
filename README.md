<p> The files are structured as follows: </p>
<p> The files within the Lalonde notebook contain the main analysis on the NSW, CPS and PSID datasets </p>
<p> The files within the simulation study contain the analysis of simulated experimental and nonexperiemntal datasets </p>
<p> The R files named within tree, are used for regression tree estimates of the propensity score on simulated and raw datasets </p>
<p> ann.ipynb is the artifical neural network and we train and optimise the neural network in this file for simulated and raw datasets </p>
